# Human_Pose_Estimation_using_AI_ML

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Human Pose Estimation (HPE) System that detects and tracks keypoints on a human body from images and videos using OpenCV DNN and MediaPipe Pose Estimation. The system can process both static images and dynamic videos, overlaying keypoints for visualization.

ðŸ“Œ How It Works?
1. 'Estimation_app' on execution displays the UI (Streamlit), where you can upload an image, and the system overlays keypoints.
2. 'HPD_video' on execution continuously tracks body keypoints of given video (path specified) and updates them in real-time.
3. 'HPD_camera' opens your webcam and let's you track the keypoints in realtime.
